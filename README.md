# Example app with styled-components and MDX

Uses styled components along with mdx-bundler  by Kent C Dodds.

2. Dynamic routing of next js is used to create static pages from mdx files in blogs folder.
   1. Folders can be nested.
   2. Code is commented.
   3. Example is shown in starter file.

## Note:

1. This is how i like to do things. Might not be very efficient but it gets the job done. I am not building a blog which is serving millions of user. For my small user base it works just fine. 
2. Might change it in the future if the performance is slow.
3. Might add some extra things to this starter according to my needs.
4. Feel free to use it as you like.
